## Overview

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity Awareness Virtual Escape Room**, a collaborative project undertaken by me ([Sage Despeignes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sage-despeignes/)), [Colleen McDaniel-Graham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleenmcdaniel-graham/), and [Zoraida Younger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zy-msw/).

## Description

In the months of March through April 2023, we embarked on an exciting journey to create a captivating and elaborate virtual escape room experience. We presented this escape room in April 2023 at the GenCyber Pre-Camp held at Prince George's Community College. Our goal was to immerse participants in a world of cybersecurity awareness using the powerful [Thinglink](https://www.thinglink.com/) platform.

## Key Features

- **Engaging Mini-Games:** We meticulously designed super engaging mini-games that challenge participants on concepts such as password security, identifying phishing emails, and understanding physical and Wi-Fi security.

- **Creative Collaboration:** The project was a whirlwind of creativity and collaboration. We created graphics, wrote scripts, and designed immersive rooms.

- **Diverse Audience:** Our virtual escape room was presented to a diverse audience of over 30 participants, ranging from elementary schoolers to high school students at Prince George's Community College GenCyber Pre-Camp. Witnessing their enthusiasm and curiosity as they navigated through our puzzles was the most rewarding part of the project.
